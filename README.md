# SafeFlightLb
SafeFlightLB is an application working with Real Data that guides you through your flight journey from Lebanon.
It can show you all the needed information about your flight using your flight number.
You can take a look at the actual COVID19 statistics in numbers of the Country youâ€™re going to.
We used Python as a programming language , Tkinter as gui interface and Beautiful soup for data scraping

## Data origin

We opted not to utilize external APIs to gather data more efficiently. Instead, we used BeautifulSoup to scrape information from the Beirut-Rafic Al Hariri International Airport website for flight data and also for Covid19 data.
